\ecvitem{Occupation or position held}{Project manager, Developer}
\ecvitem{Main activities and responsibilities}{My main task is software design and development in
  C/Python/LUA but i also help to management our IT infrastructure (we're a small firm).
  I work on both server and client development: the server is a collection of applications written
  in Python/C/GStreamer/Twisted and the client is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux) cross-browser (Internet Explorer, 
  Firefox) plugin written in C/Clutter/GStreamer used to show live or recorded streams from the
  server.
  I also work on integrating
  external hardware components like rfid devices(wec, eurochip), automation bus (modbus,
  vimar, myhome bticino, echobus, securlan..) or network camera from Axis, Panasonic, ACTi..)
  in our system. I worked on some image analysis projects like plate recognition or motion detection.
