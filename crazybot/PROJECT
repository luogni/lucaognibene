KISS

== Goals ==
 * seed
 * temperature/humidity sensors
 * video coverage (?)


== TODO ==
=== ROVER ===
 * voltage monitor > 6.4v total 2s
 * ping every s or so with data
 * assemble and try seed-tyres
 * find threadlock and use it (frenafiletti). Or try with nail polish.

=== APP MANUAL ===
 * always active
 * display if cbo is active(ping less than X seconds ago)
 * display cbo voltage/data

=== PROXY/SENSORS ===
 * think about a protocol so i can proxy data from APP to CBO and viceversa

=== APP AUTOMATIC ===
 * display live video (current jpeg for example is ok)

=== CBO BRAIN ===
 * process structure (gevent, vision, brain, ...)
 * api (video snapshot, cbo status)
 * vision. maybe keep it out-of-process and make it send data to main process.
