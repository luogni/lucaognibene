KISS

== Goals ==
 * seed
 * temperature/humidity sensors
 * video coverage (?)


== TODO ==
=== ROVER ===
 * voltage monitor > 6.4v total 2s
 * send ping every s or so with data
 * assemble and try seed-tyres
 * find threadlock and use it (frenafiletti). Or try with nail polish.

=== APP MANUAL ===
 * always active
 * display if cbo is active(ping less than X seconds ago)
 * display cbo voltage/data

=== PROXY/SENSORS ===
 * think about a protocol so i can proxy data from APP to CBO and viceversa

=== APP AUTOMATIC ===
 * display live video (current jpeg for example is ok)

=== CBO BRAIN ===
 * process structure (gevent, vision, brain, ...)
 * api (video snapshot, cbo status)
 * vision. maybe keep it out-of-process and make it send data to main process.
 * location (test-location.py). each method should give probability to each finding
   and then i should merge them and find the best one. Add a method also based on last location.
 * think about setting lower thresholds near old bot position.. if i know it should be there look better
   until i find something that looks like it
